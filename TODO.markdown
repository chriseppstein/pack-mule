Things left to do for an initial release
========================================

1. Use [Moneta](http://github.com/wycats/moneta/tree/master) as an abstraction layer on top of Memcached. Any Key/Value store that all processes can access can be used -- locking is handled by elock.
2. Build an initialzier
3. Build an installer
4. Tests, tests, tests.
